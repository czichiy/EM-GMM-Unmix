### Explanation of the EM Algorithm for Unmixing Gaussian Densities

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the parameters of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) from observed data. 
A GMM assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each characterized by its mean, covariance matrix, and mixture weight. 
The EM algorithm iteratively refines these parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data.

#### Steps of the EM Algorithm  



1.Initialization: 

Randomly initialize the parameters of the Gaussian components, including means, covariance matrices, and weights.

2.Expectation Step (E-Step): 

Compute the posterior probabilities (responsibilities) that each data point belongs to each Gaussian component.

$$\gamma_{ik} = \frac{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_i|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \pi_j \mathcal{N}(x_i|\mu_j, \Sigma_j)}$$

3.Maximization Step (M-Step):   

Update the parameters to maximize the expected log-likelihood of the data given the responsibilities.

$$\mu_k = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{ik} x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{ik}}$$

$$\Sigma_k = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{ik} (x_i - \mu_k)(x_i - \mu_k)^T}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{ik}}$$

$$\pi_k = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{ik}}{N}$$

4.Iteration:   

Repeat the E-Step and M-Step until convergence, i.e., until the parameters stabilize and the increase in log-likelihood is below a certain threshold.
